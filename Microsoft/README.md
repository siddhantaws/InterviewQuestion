- Write a program to reverse digits of an integer.
- Write a function that calculates the day of the week for any particular date in the past or future.
- Given a binary tree and data value of a node. The task is to find the sum of cousin nodes of a given node. If the given node has no cousins then return -1.
-Given a positive number N. The task is to round N to the nearest multiple of 10. The number can be so big and can contain 1000 of digits.
- At an ATM Machine, you are given an amount to withdraw and some denominations of the Notes available in the ATM Machine. Find the number of ways in which you can withdraw the amount.
- You are given 2 Linked List where each List represents a number, i.e if the linked list of length 3 is represented as 2->4->1 then it represents the number 241. You need to implement a function that computes the sum of these 2 numbers(represented as a linked list) and the resultant number should also be represented as a linked list.
- Implement a function that accepts two integers arrays 'arr1' and 'arr2' of sizes n and m respectively as its argument to find and return the sum of all uncommon elements in two arrays(elements which are present in only one of the array). Return -1 if both arrays are null. If one of the arrays is null then return the sum of all elements of the other array.
- A function accepts 2 int arrays - value array 'valarr' and index array 'indexarr', both of length 'l', as its arguments. Implement the function to permute the given value array according to the index array provided. Return the modified value array from the function.
- Given a string of consecutive digits and a number Y, the task is to find the number of minimum sets such that every set follows the below rule:
    1. Set should contain consecutive numbers
    1. No digit can be used more than once.
    1. The number in the set should not be more than Y.
