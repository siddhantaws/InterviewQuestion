- There are two kinds of bots A and B in a 1-D array. ‘A’ bot can only move left while ‘B’ can only move right. There are also empty spaces in between represented by ‘#’. But it’s also given that the bots cannot cross over each other. Given the initial state and another state, we should tell if the transformation is possible.

Sample Input-
2

`#B#A# ##BA#`
`#B#A# #A#B#`

Sample output-
Yes
No
<br/><br/>
- This was a simple one. Find the longest subarray in an array where the first element of the subarray is greater than the last element. The entire array shouldnt be taken as a subarray.

Sample Input-

1

5 4 3 2 1

Sample output –
